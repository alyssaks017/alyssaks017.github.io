<p2> The Broadway Musical <i>Hamilton</i> tells the life story of Alexander Hamilton. It also includes characters such as Aaron Burr, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. While the musical revolves
around Hamilton, it also depicts the overall stoy of the American Revolution and the formation of our country and its government after. Some historical events included in the musical are:
<br>
  <ul>
    <li> The Battle of Yorktown </li>
    <li> The writing of The Federalist Papers </li>
    <li> The Creation of our Constitution </li>
    <li> The Reynold's Affair/Reynold's Pamphlet</li>
    <li> The duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr that killed Hamilton</li>
  </ul>
<br>
Lin Manuel Miranda (pictured below), played Alexander Hamilton in the original Broadway production and also wrote the entire Musical.

<h3> My Favorite Character </h3>

<br>
  <p3> My favorite character is Aaron Burr. I feel like he is very misunderstood and is only famous as the guy who killed Hamilton, not a fine soldier and lawyer who also served as New York's Attorney General and was on the Senate. He is portrayed in the original production by Leslie Odom Jr. </p3>
